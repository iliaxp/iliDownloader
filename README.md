## iliDownloader ‚Äî Instagram Content Downloader for Android

Beautiful, fast, and reliable Instagram downloader for Android. Built with clean architecture, Kotlin, Material 3, and a Python (Chaquopy) engine under the hood. Supports background downloads with a persistent notification, live in‚Äëapp progress, clipboard auto‚Äëpaste, and a smooth, modern UI.

### Why clients love it
- **Background downloads that don‚Äôt stop**: Close the app and your downloads keep going via a Foreground Service with a rich notification.
- **Real‚Äëtime progress, everywhere**: Progress appears both in the notification and inside the app UI.
- **Zero‚Äëtap convenience**: If the input is empty, the app auto‚Äëpastes the latest link in your clipboard.
- **Multiple downloads, stress‚Äëfree**: Queue as many as you want; the app handles them sequentially without crashing.
- **Beautiful and accessible**: Material 3 styling, polished animations, light/dark assets, and clear feedback.

## Features
- **Download by username**: Grabs all public posts and saves them under `/sdcard/InstaLoaderApp/<username>`.
- **Download by post link**: Supports both `https://www.instagram.com/p/...` and `https://www.instagram.com/reel/...` to `/sdcard/InstaLoaderApp/posts`.
- **Foreground Service**: Reliable background execution with Android‚Äëcompliant notifications.
- **Live in‚Äëapp progress**: Smooth progress bar and status messaging.
- **Clipboard auto‚Äëpaste**: One‚Äëtap flow‚Äîjust copy a link and hit Download.
- **Queueing**: Enqueue multiple downloads without blocking the UI.
- **Language selection screen**: English and Persian supported.

## Tech Stack
- **Android**: Kotlin, Material 3, ViewBinding, Coroutines
- **Architecture**: Clean code principles, single‚Äëresponsibility activities, foreground service for background work
- **Python**: [Chaquopy](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/) to run the `instaloader` library inside the app
- **Libraries**: 
  - `instaloader` (Python) for reliable Instagram media downloading

## How it works (high level)
1. The user enters a username or Instagram link. If empty, the app auto‚Äëpastes from the clipboard.
2. A Foreground Service (`DownloadService`) enqueues and performs downloads in the background.
3. The service updates a persistent notification and broadcasts progress updates.
4. `MainActivity` listens to progress broadcasts and updates the in‚Äëapp progress bar.
5. The Python layer (`app/src/main/python/script.py`) uses `instaloader` to fetch media and report progress.

## Permissions
- Storage (MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE or WRITE/READ depending on API) ‚Äî to save media to `/sdcard/InstaLoaderApp/`.
- Foreground service ‚Äî to keep downloads running in the background.
- Notifications (Android 13+) ‚Äî to display foreground service progress.

The app guides the user through a friendly permission flow via `LanguageSelectionActivity` ‚Üí `PermissionGrantActivity`.

## Project Structure

```
